        Limitles is a fun place to celabrate birthday parties. You can take little kids their because you can run around and there is many different things. There are slides that are quite steep but theirs only one stairway. There are two little door shaped entrances for some big bouncy things you basiclly have to jump on them and try not to fall off r you have to restart. There are also loads of little stick up soft things there is a little forest of them. Last of all their has to been an obsticole course that is way to hard with way to many tiny slides.

          The LC2 Pool is another great way to celebrate birthdays. There is a volcano slide for little kids (I can only go on that slide for I'm far too scared to go on one of the big tall ones which I shall be going on about next). There are quite a few big slides that I am to scared to go on. There is a section of the pool for the lazy river it has a little currant to pull you along. If you can float on you back then you can be lazy on the lazy river. Their is a section for waves which goes of every 20 - 30 mins.Thier is a little baby are that for some reason I like to hang out in. Next to the baby are there is a warmer pool that is deeper I think you are actually ment to swim in that pool. Although I am not 100% sure because I've never seen anyone actually swim in it. The reason I think you are ment to swim thier is because the swimming lessons are held thier. There is also a little surfing are.

      <p class="text-muted">
          Playzone is an absolutly huge are of soft play. The slides I think are its main point so thats what I will be telling you all about today. The rainbow slides are in Rainbow order but I find higher than any other place I'v visited. The red slide is terrifieng. I have been on it once and never again it just goes straight down. The blue slide is a calmer version. I have been on that and actually enjoyed it it is wavy but still very high. I enjoyed the blue slide and went on it and only that until the time I had to leave. The red slide has two areas but they are both terrifiying. One is a little bit further down from the other which is so high up.
